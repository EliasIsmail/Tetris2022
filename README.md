# Tetris2022
Tetris made in Python!

# Running the game
- Tetris.py is the main file, and will lead you to a main menu, in which actions can be taken from.
- To run the game, you are obviously going to have to have Python installed (preferrably 3.7 or later)
- Also, you might have to pip install some packages :)

# Controls
- Game controls can be found in the 'About' section in the main menu. 

# Singleplayer
- Objective: Get on the leaderboard (top 20), while you enjoy the music ( if you have the same music taste as me :/ ).
- How: Clear a lot of lines! The score values are based upon the original tetris, in which multiple line clears are the best! (As of right now, the game does not officially support T-Spins score-wise, and sometimes performance-wise)
- 
# Multiplayer
- Objective: Destroy your opponent.
- Time: 200 seconds.
- How: Knock your opponent out 3 times, or be in the lead when times run out. If time runs out, the winner is firstly determined by the number of knockouts, and secondly by the number of lines sent. If these values are both equal, the game is declared a draw. PS: Make sure to go for long combos, as this will add lines to the opponents board.

- Additional info: Bombs that appear as a result of lines sent by your opponent, can be cleared and will instantly start a combo.
